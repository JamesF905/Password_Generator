## Description

This is the first attempt at building a professional looking web page, based on the concepts we learned in Modules 1-3. This project therefore demonstartes some of those new found concepts including but not limited to:

- Semantic Html
- Advanced CSS
- Javascript 
- Responsive Design (Particularly the use of FLEX, and @Media querys)

This file as well as all the other files in this repo will be updated in further lessons.
